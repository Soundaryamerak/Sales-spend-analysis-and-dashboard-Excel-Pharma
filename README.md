**Observations & Insights:**
1. The heatmap shows the USA had the highest total health expenditure over the years, followed by Canada and Australia.
2. Significant Health Expenditure Growth in Australia: This trend indicates a growing global spend in healthcare, potentially due to increasing healthcare costs, aging populations, and advancements in medical technology.
3. Positive Correlation Between Healthcare Expenditure and GDP in Australia: This correlation indicates that as Australia allocates a larger portion of its GDP to healthcare, the overall expenditure on healthcare increases, reflecting the countryâ€™s prioritization of health in its economic policies.
4. Total Health Expenditure Increasing Faster Than Per Capita Spending in Australia: This indicates that the overall healthcare budget is growing significantly faster, potentially driven by factors such as rising healthcare demands and increased healthcare services, even though the per capita spending increase is more gradual.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Policy Review:** Countries with high healthcare expenditures should review their healthcare policies to ensure efficient allocation of resources.
2. **Investment in Healthcare:** Countries with increasing healthcare costs should consider investing in preventive healthcare and technology to manage long-term expenses.
3. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Regularly monitor healthcare expenditure trends and evaluate the impact of healthcare policies on economic growth and population health.

**Observations & Insights:**
1. High Sales of NO2BE: The drug NO2BE consistently had the highest sales from 2014 to 2019, making up 54% of the total quantity sold over the years.
2. Fluctuating Sales Across Years: The sales quantities for other drugs, such as NO5B and R03, show significant fluctuations across different years, indicating varying demand trends.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Inventory Management:** Based on the high sales of NO2BE, pharmacies should ensure sufficient stock levels to meet demand. Additionally, they should closely monitor the sales trends of other drugs to adjust inventory accordingly.
2. **Marketing Strategies:** Develop targeted marketing strategies for drugs with fluctuating sales to stabilize demand and increase customer awareness.
3. **Sales Forecasting:** Implement advanced sales forecasting techniques to predict future demand trends accurately and optimize inventory management.
